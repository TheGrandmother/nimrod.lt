Nimrod Language Support for LightTable

This plugin is still under heavy development and at the moment it merely adds a basic syntax highlight, auto-indenting, syntax checking when the file is saved and compiler-assisted "jump to definition".

## Installation

1. Make sure Nimrod is in your PATH
2. From LightTable's plugin manager, choose the available tab and double-click the "Nimrod" plugin to install it.
